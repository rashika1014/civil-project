            <h2>Engineering Land Survey</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
              This service involves measuring physical features of the land with great precision.
              Based on these verifications, our survey engineers establish the dimensions, distances and angles of the land.
              For accurate results, concepts of geometry, trigonometry, engineering, math and physics are applied. 
              Application of state of art technology such as GPS, AutoCAD software, and digital photography add quality to land development
              and construction projects.

            <p style="font-size: large;">
              As per the topographical land survey, layout marking and demarcation is done inclusive of roads, plots, 
              commercial spaces and extra spaces for public use etc. We ensure allotment of these spaces is as per the government norms. 
              Based on the approvals from concerned authorities and clients, 
              layout design is marked on the respective site as instructed by the site engineer.

            <h2>Contour Survey</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
              Our contour survey services are cost effective and can be customized to suffice the client specifications. 
              Primary objective of conducting these surveys is to identify any noticeable difference in elevation of the existing land. 
              Slopes matching the same height are joined using imaginary lines that are known as contours. 
              Contour map highlights details of the existing land condition. 
              Based on the findings of contour survey, the design team can decide on cutting, filling, widening, and leveling the land.

            <h2>Estimating Earth Moving Work Volumes</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;">
              For earth moving work contractors the key to survival is an accurate estimate of earth moving work quantities. 
              Without an accurate estimate, the contractor will have little or no chance to present an accurate bill of excuted work. 
              And without an accurate estimate of earth moving work volumes, the contractor will be unable to properly assign construction 
              assets or formulate a project schedule.
              Estimation of earth moving work (Filling & Cutting) is very essential data for estimating soil filling / cutting after
              & before earth moving work has been executed. As per the site requirements our specialist technicians work hard on site
              to get great precision value of your money and time.
